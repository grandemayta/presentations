## Getting Started

After downloading the boilerplate, your first order of business is to open a terminal and run

```
or 
```bash
npm install
```
Then, to start up the local server, run

Open a browser and hit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and we are ready to roll.

## Build & Deployment

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Keep calm and code!
